Congratulations on completing your first Express.js application! You've expanded on your knowledge of modularizing applications and successfully separated the server logic from the routes. You've also created brand-new functionality for the zookeepers at the zoo!

Here's a recap of the things you accomplished in this lesson:

Broke animal functions into their own files within lib/.

Used express.Router() instead of app.

Created new endpoints and data for zookeepers.

Now you can confidently set up an Express.js server that serves HTML and JSON to a client.

Here's a recap of everything you accomplished in this module:

Used Express.js to create a Node.js web server.

Set up GET routes to serve selective JSON data based on parameters (req.param and req.query).

Used Heroku to deploy a server and learned about the difference between development and production environments.

Created POST routes to allow your server to accept incoming data and tested it with Insomnia.

Learned how and why to use middleware in Express.js.

Updated your server to serve client-side code for users to interface with.

Revisited the Fetch API to make requests to your server.

Modularized and scaled your API by using the Express.js Router.

Tested your application using Jest and helped make it predictable as you scaled up.

You now have a solid understanding of how to build servers to transfer data to and from a client. In the next module, youâ€™ll add performant data persistence to our back-end applications with SQL databases.
